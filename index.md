<img src="images/stroke.jpg" width ="500">

## Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze a Kaggle data set and to create a predictive model to evaluate stroke risk that could be used by medical professionals to target risk mitigations.

## Data

The Kaggle [data](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/metadata) provided by [fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano).

Southern Stroke Mortality [Mapping Data](https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/maps_data.htm) provided by [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov).

## EDA 

A pandas-profiling [report](https://sdloyd.github.io/Stroke/pandasprofile/stroke-pandas-profile-report.html) is available.

## Code

The python [code](https://github.com/SDLoyd/Stroke/blob/master/code/stroke.ipynb) is available as a Jypyter notebook.

If you have trouble with GitHub rendering the file, please try [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SDLoyd/Stroke/blob/master/code/stroke.ipynb).
